# NFT Airdrop Tool Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Duplicate NFTs in Review Screen**: The review screen was showing the same NFT twice instead of distinct NFTs.
2. **Cross-contamination of Amounts**: The amount set for NFT A was incorrectly applied to NFT B.
3. **Review Screen Issues**: The NFT configuration wasn't properly displaying the NFTs being sent.

## Solution Implemented

We've implemented a more modular approach to handle both token and NFT distributions, following these key steps:

### 1. Created an AirdropUtils Class

Created a new utility class in `src/utils/AirdropUtils.ts` that provides shared functionality for both token and NFT distributions, featuring:

- `createDistributionRecord` - Creates a distribution record with unique entity tracking
- `updateDistributionAmount` - Updates a distribution amount ensuring no cross-contamination
- `prepareNFTDistributionsForTransaction` - Prepares NFT distributions for transaction
- `getDistributionTypeLabel` - Gets the correct distribution type label for display

### 2. Enhanced NFT and Token Types

Updated the types in `src/types/index.ts` to include entity tracking properties:

```typescript
// Added to both TokenDistribution and NFTDistribution interfaces
_entityId?: string;   // Unique ID for the entity (tokenId or collectionId)
_entityType?: string; // Type of entity ('nft', 'collection', or 'token')
```

### 3. Updated NFT and Token Handlers

Modified both the token and NFT handlers to use the new utilities:

- `handleSelectNFT` - Now uses unique entity tracking to prevent duplicates
- `handleSelectCollection` - Improved collection handling with entity tracking
- `handleSetNFTAmount` - Now uses the utility to update amounts without cross-contamination
- `handleSetTokenAmount` - Also updated to use the utility for consistency

### 4. Improved the Review Screen

Enhanced the ReviewAndConfirm component to:

- Use unique entity IDs for key properties to prevent React duplicates
- Filter out duplicate NFTs in display
- Display proper amounts for each NFT
- Use consistent label rendering through the utility class

### 5. Execution Logic Enhancement

Updated the executeAirdrop function to properly use entity IDs:

- Each NFT distribution now carries its own amount through the whole flow
- Amount values are preserved and properly displayed in the review screen
- Transaction building now respects the individual NFT amounts

## Benefits

1. **No More Duplicates**: Each NFT now has a unique identifier ensuring it's only shown once
2. **Amount Integrity**: Each distribution maintains its own amount without cross-contamination
3. **Modular Code**: Token and NFT handling share common utilities, making the code more maintainable
4. **Reliable Review**: The review screen now accurately represents what will be included in the transaction

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test creating multiple NFT distributions with different amounts
2. Verify the review screen shows unique NFTs with their correct amounts
3. Confirm transaction execution includes the correct NFTs and amounts
4. Test mixing token and NFT distributions to ensure both work correctly
